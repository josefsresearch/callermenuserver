This is the basic server that handles requests from the Caller Menu Application.

It is a simple Django App, but future developers should understand how Dhango works before changing the code.

The Procfile and requirements.txt are so the app can be run on Heroku. These files will need to be changed (as well as the settings in settings.py) if this app is hosted somewhere else.

This server was set up to handle requests from one client as a means of testing the Android Caller Menu application. Changes will need to be made if many users are planning on making requests (production mode).

Currently this server is running on Josef's free Heroku account, but the server will need to be moved to a paid account before it is ready for production mode. 

Please email the developer if you have questions after reading the Django documentation.
